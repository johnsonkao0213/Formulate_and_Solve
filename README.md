## üëÄ About BeyondX Construction

**BeyondX** is a novel algebra reasoning benchmark within multi-unknown, which addresses a limitation that existing math datasets are dominated by problems with at most two unknowns. In total, BeyondX includes 464 examples generated from 2 different source datasets (ALG514 and DRAW-1K). The dataset is constructed via a novel approach called Progressive Expansion, which applies a divide-and-conquer strategy:
1. **Scenario Diversification:** Begin by expanding existing simpler problems to increase scenario diversity.
2. **Incremental Expansion:** Instead of expanding problems from 1-2 unknowns to *N* unknowns in a single leap, incrementally introduce one new variable at a time.
3. **Enhanced Solvability:** The problem expansion is broken into several simpler stages, making the entire generation more tractable for LLMs.

## üëÄ About Formulate-and-Solve

**Formulate-and-Solve** is an automated prompting method designed for LLMs to solve math problems with an arbitrary number of unknowns. It incorporates a set of principles to instruct LLMs in generating demonstrations automatically and empowers LLMs to translate problems into equations and subsequently utilize external tools (Sympy) to solve them.

## Dataset Usage

### Data Downloading

All the data examples were divided into three subsets: *BeyondX_3*, *BeyondX_4*, and *BeyondX_5*.

- **BeyondX_3**: 194 examples for three unknowns.
- **BeyondX_4**: 158 examples for four unknowns.
- **BeyondX_5**: 112 examples for five unknowns.

You can download this dataset by the following command (make sure that you have installed [Huggingface Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/quickstart)):

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("Johnson0213/BeyondX")
```

Here are some examples of how to access the downloaded dataset:

```python
# print the first example on the BeyondX
print(dataset["train"][0])
print(dataset["train"][0]['id']) # print the problem id 
print(dataset["train"][0]['problem']) # print the problem text 
print(dataset["train"][0]['system_of_equations']) # print the system of equations
print(dataset["train"][0]['ans']) # print the answer
print(dataset["train"][0]['source']) # print the data source
```

### Data Format

The dataset is provided in json format and contains the following attributes:

```json
{
    "problem": [string] The problem text,
    "system_of_equations": [list] The system of equations for the problem,
    "ans": [list] The correct answer for the problem,
    "id": [int] The problem ID, e.g., 1,
    "source": [string] The source dataset from which the problem was taken
}
```

### Data Visualization

üé∞ You can interactively explore the dataset [here](https://johnsonkao0213.github.io/Formulate_and_Solve/#visualization).


### Data Construction

The **BeyondX** dataset is derived from two collected datasets: [ALG514](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/alg514) and [DRAW-1K](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/draw-1k). To efficiently generate a large corpus of multi-unknown problems, we developed a novel pipeline that automatically expands existing problems to *N* unknowns.

```
# dataset_name = {"alg514", "draw1k", "BeyondX_3", "BeyondX_4"}
bash scripts/create_dataset.sh ${dataset_name}
```

## üîÆ Evaluations on BeyondX via Formulate-and-Solve

### Requirements
Make sure you have Python>=3.10 installed on your machine.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Evaluation Pipelines

#### Prepare LLMs

##### Set your OpenAI and Gemini API key
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=(YOUR OPENAI API KEY)
export GEMINI_API_KEY=(YOUR GEMINI API KEY)
```

##### For open-source LLMs
Download your model or get their names for Huggingface. And replace the following path by where you locate your models or your models name.

#### Quick Start for Running Evaluation
```
# model_name = {"gpt3", "gpt4", "gemini"}
# dataset_name = {"BeyondX_3", "BeyondX_4", "BeyondX_5"}
bash scripts/run.sh ${model_name} ${dataset_name}
```
